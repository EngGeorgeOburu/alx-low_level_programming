This repository contains code for the following tasks from the ALX low-level programming course:

    Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line. 0-puts_recursion.c: 0-puts_recursion.c
    Write a function that prints a string in reverse. 1-print_rev_recursion.c: 1-print_rev_recursion.c
    Write a function that returns the length of a string. 2-strlen_recursion.c: 2-strlen_recursion.c
    Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number. 3-factorial.c: 3-factorial.c
    Write a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y. 4-pow_recursion.c: 4-pow_recursion.c
    Write a function that returns the natural square root of a number. 5-sqrt_recursion.c: 5-sqrt_recursion.c
    Write a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0. 6-is_prime_number.c: 6-is_prime_number.c

Advanced

    Write a function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not. 100-is_palindrome.c: 100-is_palindrome.c
    Write a function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0. 101-wildcmp.c: 101-wildcmp.c
Instructions

To compile and run the code for each task, navigate to the corresponding directory and run the following commands:

gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 <task>.c -o <task>
./<task>

For example, to compile and run the code for the first task, you would navigate to the 0x08-recursion/ directory and run the following commands:

gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 0-puts_recursion.c -o 0-puts_recursion
./0-puts_recursion

This will print the following output to the console:

Puts with recursion
